## Method Details
This [Paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Ulyanov_Deep_Image_Prior_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf) was implemented. We have implemented three image enhancement processes :
- Super Resolution(Reconstructs High-Resolution (HR) image from its corresponding Low-Resolution (LR) image)
- Image Inpainting(Creating or modifying pixels which also includes tasks like deblurring, text removal, artifact removal etc)
- Denoising(Process of removing noise from the Images)
